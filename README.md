## Usage

To use this bot, you'll have to [install it from GitHub's Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/agba-merger). Make sure you give it access to the scopes it is requesting for.

When you have a pull request that you want to schedule with the help of the bot, simply call its attention to that PR by typing the following in the PR's comment:

```md
"Yo! **@agba-merger**, please **merge** this pull request on **2023-01-22**"
```

You can choose to construct this sentence in any manner that seems appropriate to you. The keywords you shouldn't leave out are the name of the bot **@agba-merger**, the **merge**, and your date in **"YYYY-MM-DD** format.
